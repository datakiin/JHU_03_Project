# JHU 03 Project
This is a repository for all code, and associated files written for the Coursera JHU Getting and Cleaning Data course project.


Please find all project-related materials in the UCI HAR Dataset directory, however, copies of the important files have been put into this main directory to fulfill the submission requirement.

    Unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive, say C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\

    Put run_analysis.R into C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\UCI HAR Dataset\

    In RStudio: setwd("C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents\\R\\UCI HAR Dataset\\"), followed by: source("run_analysis.R")

    Use data <- read.table("tidy_data_avg.txt") to read the tidy data file as per Step 5 of project instructions.
